## ü§î Asking Questions
If you have a question, check that nobody asked this question before.

We will make our best to answer you as quickly as possible!
>If you find that this question has already been asked in an issue, add üëç as *reaction* on the issue.

## üõ† Work on MockSwift
>‚ö†Ô∏èNote that this framework is based on development version of Swift 5.1 and the Xcode project on Xcode11 Beta. So if you find any problem while working on MockSwift please make us known by opening an issue as a [**Bug Report**](https://github.com/leoture/MockSwift/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).‚ö†Ô∏è

#### With Xcode
- Open `MockSwift.xcworkspace`.
- To build or test the project: choose `MockSwift-Package` scheme on `My Mac`.
- Before using playgrounds build the `MockSwiftPlayground` scheme.

#### With Swift Package Manager
- To build or test the project: use the respective commands `swift build` and `swift test`.
>‚ö†Ô∏è To run tests on a Linux environment:
  - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  - Execute the command `docker-compose up`.

## üêû Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a problem, check that nobody already reported it.  
Otherwise, please let us know by opening an issue as a [**Bug Report**](https://github.com/leoture/MockSwift/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=). We would be grateful!  

You can report everything that looks strange to you: a crash, a bad design of the API that does not allow autocompletion, everything !!

We try to comply with [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). So if you find that a part of the code does not respect them, don't hesitate to report it üòá.

>If you find that this Bug has already been reported in an issue, add üëç as *reaction* on the issue.

## üöÄ Feature Proposals
Do you have an idea to improve MockSwift? Share it with us by opening an issue as a [**Feature Request**](https://github.com/leoture/MockSwift/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=).  

The issue will be the place to discuss the proposal, so please detail your idea, even if you don't know how to implement it.

>If you are interested by a feature proposal described in an issue, add üëç as *reaction* on the issue.

## üéâ Pull Requests
Every Pull Requests must be attached to, at least, one issue. Help us review the code by explaining the implementation, the tests and by adding any information you may find useful. For now, all Pull Requests must target the *master* branch.  

All written codes should be commented and tested as much as possible. Insure that the code compiles and that the tests pass. Reviews will start only when continuous integration will be successfully completed.

We try to comply with [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). So please make your best to comply with it as well.
